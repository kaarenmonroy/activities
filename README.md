# Thermographic images analyzer

This code in matlab, which is based on C programming language, reads a thermographic image from the file selection, and displays histograms for each RGB element and their average in a single graph, in different graphs and in an 3D graph. 
Following that analysis, it is asked to the user if he/she wants to create a personal colormap different from the hot iron or the rainbow colormap (this two are the common colormaps used for the thermographic camaras). If yes, then the user set the number of categories (colors) desire to visualize and can establish a different color for each. 
After that, the thermographic image is displayed with the new personalized color map and in the console, the percentages areas for each category is calculated. 

In the project you can find 2 thermopgraphic images; 1 with the hot iron colormap and the other with the rainbow colormap.
